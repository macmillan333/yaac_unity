# Yet Another Asteroid Clone
A work-in-progress entry to the r/ProgrammerHumor hackathon. Play the classic Asteroid game with new features such as items, level editor and (gasp) loot boxes! *insert more marketing and corpspeak* This game is so fun and addicting, once you start playing, you can never put it down!

If you have enough patience to actually start the game, that is.
